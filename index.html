        <p>Pascal and I finally moved to our new home in Auroville today. We were staying in Kuilapalayam for the past two weeks, but that was just too far away from our workplaces and the apartment was also very small for two people. Now we live in Martuvam Healing Forest in the Green Belt and I love it so far. The place is a lot bigger, has tons of storage room, and despite still being outside the inner city borders of Auroville, is a lot more central than Kuilapalayam.

        <p>Today, my third week at SVARAM started. I am currently teaching myself webdesign in order to be able to take over Simon's work, and I will also start posting on our Facebook and Instagram accounts soon. Additionally, I normally spend the mornings in the workshop to get to know all the employees and help building instruments, but since I have an open wound on my elbow from a bike accident at the moment, I'll stay in the office to avoid it getting dirty.</p>
